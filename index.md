# About That Guy Over There

Web Developer passionate about designing and implementing his own ideas. 

Aiming to finding solutions for every daily problem making use of the of the latest technologies and best code practices. 

Always ready to be challenged and learn new things.

Going smoothly into personal tastes, that guy over there: 
- loves to discover new music; 
- would easily accept to be the Assistant to the Regional Manager (if that Regional Manager is Michael Scott, obviously); 
- is dangerously addicted to sushi.

“Good morning, and in case I don’t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!”
