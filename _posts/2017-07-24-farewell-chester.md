The world is all talking about Chester's departure and I'm nothing more than just another person doing the same but...well...I do.

I don't want to judge his choice but I confess that I can't not be a little bit disappointed when there were children and a huge number of fans who would follow him everywhere...but well...it was his choice. 

Anyway, this is a short and simple Thanks for everything...because people can matter in the most different ways.

And again, I do...I really do.

Farewell Chester
